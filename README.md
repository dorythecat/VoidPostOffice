# The Void Post Office
A game made for the [Roulette](https://roulette.hackclub.com) YSWS program from
Hack Club.

> You have been assigned to work at the Void Post Office, an interdimensional relay
  station. Packets from everywhere across the known multiverse arrive and leave the
  office. You are tasked with packing the Interdimensional Cube to send the packets
  to the right place. Will you be able to send all the packets, or will time win
  the race?

# How to play
Your objective is to safely deliver all the packages in The Tube. This requires
having certain precautions to consider, which, if not followed, will lead to you
losing your job, and therefore, the game! The precautions are:

- Floating boxes should always be kept under another box, and never near the top
  of The Tube, as they might escape into The Darkness.

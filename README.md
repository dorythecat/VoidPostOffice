# The Void Post Office
A game made for the [Roulette](https://roulette.hackclub.com) YSWS program from
Hack Club.

> You have been assigned to work at the Void Post Office, an interdimensional relay
  station. Packets from everywhere across the known multiverse arrive and leave the
  office. You are tasked with packing the Interdimensional Cube to send the packets
  to the right place. Will you be able to send all the packets, or will time win
  the race?

# How to play
Your objective is to safely deliver all the packages in The Tube. To do so, you
can drag and drop the boxes in The Tube to move them around.

You need to have certain precautions, though, which, if not followed, will lead to
you losing your job, and therefore, the game!

The precautions are:

- No two boxes may occupy the same space on The Tube, under risk of [[REDACTED]].
- No box may be lifted or outside The Grid at the time of transportation, due to a
  malfunction of the microspace turbo-encabulator.
- Floating boxes (red) should always be kept under another box, and never near the
  top of The Tube, as they might escape into [[REDACTED]].
- Sinking boxes (green) cannot be placed above any other box, not even other
  sinking boxes, due to disruption of cargo during [[REDACTED]]. Be especially
  careful of putting sinking boxes atop floating boxes, as they might [[REDACTED]].
- All sentient boxes (black) should have exactly three other sentient boxes in their
  row and column. This means that a box in a row with only one other box will
  need a box placed either in the same row or column. If this rule is not kept,
  sentient boxes might [[REDACTED]].
- Be careful with quantum boxes! They might teleport randomly at any moment! It does
  seem like they tire as time goes though...
